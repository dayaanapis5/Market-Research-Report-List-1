<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inoculant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seed Inoculants</li><li>Soil Inoculants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inoculant market consists of two primary types: seed inoculants and soil inoculants. Seed inoculants are applied directly to seeds before planting, enhancing germination and promoting beneficial microbial activity in the soil, which can improve nutrient uptake. Soil inoculants, on the other hand, are introduced directly into the soil, enriching the existing microbial community to enhance soil health and fertility. Both types play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture by boosting crop yields and promoting environmental sustainability.</p></p>
